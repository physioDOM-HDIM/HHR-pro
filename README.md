PhysioDom–HDIM proposes an ICT platform that offers on a large territory a new service – Home Dietary 
Intake Monitoring based on readings and monitoring of weight, lean/fat ratio and physical activity, 
complemented with an intervention structure and strategy – the Home Diet Coaching. PhysioDom-HDIM is 
an innovative ICT solution that enhances living conditions for senior citizens, as well as improving 
the efficiency and integration health and social care systems. The PhysioDom HDIM system has been 
developed based on a small French pilot, the Reseau Vercors Sante project, which successfully trialled 
the system in 50 homes and engaged with 70 health and social care professionals. The pilot was run over 
a two year period and delivered positive results and acceptance by its users. It now needs to be on a 
larger scale that involves all of the players -from institutions to end-users at home.
